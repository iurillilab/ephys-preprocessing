# ephys-preprocessing
Python code for the preprocessing of ephys data.

We're keeping here also some intro tutorials covering the basics of the library usage and data 
policies and SOP in the lab.

## Requirements
Current aim for this repo is to include all the code for ephys data preprocessing using the 
`spikeinterface` library. To run things here, you'll need that to be installed.

## Content
The repo is organized as follows:
 - `/tutorials`: introductory notebooks with examples of the library usage
 - `/scripts`: the actual scripts to be used for data preprocessing

 ## TODO:
  - define organization of scripts for different data sources
  - put there the actual code for preprocessing :)
  - make data processing tutorials

## Useful resources
- [`spikeinterface` documentation](https://spikeinterface.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) and [getting started tutorial](https://spikeinterface.readthedocs.io/en/0.96.0/getting_started/plot_getting_started.html)
- [`Kilosort` repository, with links for documentation](https://github.com/MouseLand/Kilosort)
- [`Phy` documentation](http://phy.readthedocs.org/en/latest/)
- [Intro to manual curation with `Phy`](ttps://phy.readthedocs.io/en/latest/sorting_user_guide/)


## Expected future changes

In the future Kilosort will hopefully [move to python](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2023.01.07.523036v1.full.pdf).
